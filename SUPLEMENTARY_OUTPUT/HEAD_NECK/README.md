#TCGA Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSC) â€“ Gene Expression and Survival Analysis

This repository contains results from the analysis of gene expression and survival in the **TCGA Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (TCGA-HNSC)** cohort using HTG_auto function from HTGAnalyzer package.  
Data were accessed through [cBioPortal](https://www.cbioportal.org/study/summary?id=hnsc_tcga_gdc), originally released by the Genomic Data Commons (GDC) in **July 2024**.

##Dataset Overview

- **Samples**: 502 primary tumor samples  
- **Sex distribution**: 133 female, 369 male patients  
- **Included data**:
  - Gene expression (raw read counts)
  - Harmonized clinical annotations
- **Key clinical variables**:
  - `SEX` used as a contrast factor in analyses
  - `OS_months` and `OS_status` used to define overall survival

Gene identifiers were standardized by converting Entrez IDs to HGNC symbols using the `org.Hs.eg.db` database to ensure consistency across datasets.
