## 📂 Supplementary Output

This repository includes two main folders containing complete transcriptomic analysis results:

### 🔹 `HEAD_NECK/`
Contains the analysis performed on **TCGA Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSC)** samples, including:

- Differential Expression Analysis (DEA)
- Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)
- Tumor Microenvironment estimation (TME)
- Survival analysis

### 🔹 `HTG_data_tutorial/`
Includes the analysis of in-house generated data using the **HTG Transcriptome Panel** on 58 FFPE VSCC (Vulvar Squamous Cell Carcinoma) samples. The HTG Transcriptome Panel contains:

- 19,398 probes for human RNA transcripts  
- 218 control probes (positive, negative, gDNA, ERCC)

RNA libraries were generated following HTG EdgeSeq protocols and sequenced on an Illumina platform. QC was assessed for 50 out of 58 samples using the HTG EdgeSeq Reveal software (see Table S1).

This folder includes:

- Raw and processed data  
- DEA, GSEA, TME, and survival results  
- Visualizations and summary plots in PDF  
- Gene lists and enrichment outputs in CSV format

> ⚠️ Some large files (e.g., raw count matrices or full GSEA plots) were excluded due to size limitations.
